Hello dear reader,

You are reading my readme file about my first step into Cyber Security.
I want to achive a high-level of understanding of Cyber security and later on implementing AI.
The first thing i plan to achive this goal is to understand the basics, do a few projects and understand the fundamentals of cyber.
The second step is to learn machine learning on the field of cyber. 
Altough i have an understanding of how machine learning and deep learning works and the basics, i do have not a clue about how to implement AI to cyber.

On this GH repo you'll see the 4 projects i did on the topic of network.
The projects them selves are self-explaining and i do not think about explaning them in detail. The given comments will provide enough information.

In the coming next repos i think to upload more projects about: Network, Cyber and AI in cyber.
I upload my projects so that my GH page becomes more informational about how i plan to continue my career path.

Thank you for reading.
